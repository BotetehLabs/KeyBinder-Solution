# KeybinderSolution
KeyBinder Solution is a simple tool that allows you to press up to 3 recorded keyboard keys using a custom hotkey.
I created this tool when I was playing a mini-game where I needed to press Shift + F1 to lock the speed meter, but it became annoying, so I linked it to a mouse button. If you're looking for a simple tool like this, feel free to use it.
It's a basic Windows application built in Visual Studio (C#). The current version supports up to 3 hotkeys, but I may update it in the future if needed. Please feel free to suggest any features that might help.
Constructive criticism is welcome.

**Optional:** Iâ€™m a newcomer, and any support is greatly appreciated! Feel free to support me financially via my Binance ID: 443409650.
